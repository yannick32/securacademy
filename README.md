# securacademy

A simple student/course management API used to demonstrate Spring Security as follows:

- Different authentication methods
    - HTTP Basic
    - Form-based
    - JSON Web Token (JWT)
- Permission vs Role-based authorization
- 'Remember me' tokens

## Usage
Use Spring active profiles to switch between the three different authentication configurations
`basicAuth`
`formAuth`
`jwtAuth`
